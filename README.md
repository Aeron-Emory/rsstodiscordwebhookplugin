A simple WordPress plugin that adds a section in the settings tab for you to add a link to an RSS feed and your webhook for discord and it will post periodically every hour and post it to your discord channel.

Here's the manual way
Open your FTP File manager or whatever
Go to wp-content/plugins/
Create new folder like a folder called discordrss
Upload the php file in there you got from here, and done
